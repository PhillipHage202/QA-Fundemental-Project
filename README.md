# QA-Fundemental-Project

##Brief
The brief provided to us for this project sets the following out as its overall objective: "To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training."


In addition to what has been set out in the brief, I am also required to include the following:
•	A Trello board
•	A relational database, consisting of at least two tables that model a relationship
•	Clear documentation of the design phase, app architecture and risk assessment
•	A python-based functional application that follows best practices and design principles
•	Test suites for the application, which will include automated tests for validation of the application
•	A front-end website, created using Flask
•	Code integrated into a Version Control System which will be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine

My Approach
To achieve this, I have decided to produce a simple exercise app that must allow a person to do the following:
•	Create posts of workout (satisfies 'Create') with the following information:
o	Author of the post
o	Description of the workout or how many numbers of pushups was done
•	View and update their post (satisfies 'Read' and 'Update')
•	Delete their post (satisfies 'Delete')
•	Read the post (satisfies 'Read')

### All  relevant images of the project can be found in the documents in the repo.

Known Issues
There are a few bugs with the current build of the app:
•	An issue with the templates where sometimes the post is not visible

Future Improvements
There are a number of improvements I would like to implement (outside of current bugs):
•	Implement a login system where a user can be unique.
•	Improve the front-end of the application 
•	Have a many to many relationship
