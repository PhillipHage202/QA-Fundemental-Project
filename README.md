# QA-Fundemental-Project

### Brief
The brief provided to us for this project sets the following out as its overall objective: "To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training."


In addition to what has been set out in the brief, I am also required to include the following:

•	A Trello board

•	A relational database, consisting of at least two tables that model a relationship

•	Clear documentation of the design phase, app architecture and risk assessment

•	A python-based functional application that follows best practices and design principles

•	Test suites for the application, which will include automated tests for validation of the application

•	A front-end website, created using Flask

•	Code integrated into a Version Control System which will be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine

### My Approach

To achieve this, I have decided to produce a simple exercise app that must allow a person to do the following:

•	Create posts of workout (satisfies 'Create') with the following information:

o	Author of the post

o	Description of the workout or how many numbers of pushups was done

•	View and update their post (satisfies 'Read' and 'Update')

•	Delete their post (satisfies 'Delete')

•	Read the post (satisfies 'Read')

* CI Pipeline
* Project tracking 
* Risk assessment
* Testing Reports
* Front-End Design

### Known Issues

•	An issue with the  layout templates where sometimes the posts is not visible.

•	Unfortunately due to connection errors/ firewall issues, the application could not connect to GCP database and Gunicorn

### Future Improvements

There are a number of improvements I would like to implement :

•	Will try to fix the connection error from gcp

•	Implement a login system where a user can be unique

•	Add a function where users can post images

•	Add a function where users can register via from their social media account

•	Add a GPS function where users can track their running

•	Add a video function where users can upload and view videos

•	Improve the front-end design of the application
